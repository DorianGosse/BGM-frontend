It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

# The Project!

This is a hobby project that I created with real world application. As someone who has used a number of different technologies and applications targeted toward type-1 diabetics and finding almost all of them lack luster, I thought I would take a crack at creating my own in spare time.

This applications front end is built in React with plain Jane HTML5 CSS3. The application includes the use of Redux as well as some validation and graphical frameworks.

## The Goal

The goal of this application is to allow type-1 diabetics to track everything from their meals, carb intake, excercise, insulin injections and much more. With the use of a dashboard users will be able to get information at a glance or as granular as they desire with the help of graphs, charts, and so much more.
